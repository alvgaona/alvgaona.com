        I have a strong interest in autonomous systems, particularly in the
        field of mobile robotics. The challenges presented by problems like
        perception, localization, navigation, control, and vehicle modeling
        deeply intrigue me. My enthusiasm lies in developing and researching
        novel algorithms tailored to tackle these issues. I enjoy putting these
        algorithms to the test within simulated environments to offer practical
        solutions for real-world problems.
        <br /><br />
        Additionally, I have a curiosity for exploring machine learning algorithms
        and their application in this context. On a related note, I take pride in
        being a contributor to the PyTorch library since 2020, where I've had the
        opportunity to contribute to its growth and development.{' '}

        While I specialize in autonomous systems, my background also extends to
        software engineering. I find particular enjoyment in working with
        front-end technologies and staying current with the latest trends. This
        knowledge allows me to effectively showcase my side projects within the
        community.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Aside from my software engineering skills, I'm also involved in exciting
        research projects. I have numerous interests and a few publications that
        you can explore at your leisure.

        When I'm not busy coding or researching, I love to unwind with sports.
        Basketball and football are my go-to choices, but I'm also a huge
        Formula 1 fan. In fact, I enjoy keeping up with all the latest news and
        races!
