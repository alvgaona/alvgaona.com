tl;dr

For nearly a year now, I've been using the Zed editor as my primary development tool.
It has dramatically boosted my productivity across both my day job and side projects.
Along the way, I discovered Pixi, which has become my favorite package manager.
As someone quite involved in robotics, Pixi has been transformative for my workflow,
particularly because it makes ROS2 available out of the box with minimal setup hassle.
The fact that it enables true cross-platform ROS2 development is revolutionary - we're
witnessing a real paradigm shift in robotics development.

I recently began working on implementing EKF Mono SLAM, a well-known algorithm in
robotics computer vision. Though I've delayed this project for a while, I'm now
ready to complete it. To maximize efficiency, I decided to leverage my preferred
toolkit: Zed, Pixi, and ROS2.

However, this side project is just an excuse to demonstrate using Zed, Pixi and ROS2.
While integrating these tools wasn't trivial and took time to configure properly, the
investment was absolutely worth it. There's still room for improved
interoperability between them, but the current workflow is already quite powerful.

## Zed

Let's start by setting up the Zed editor.
While the initial configuration might take some getting used to, especially for those
familiar with IDEs like CLion, PyCharm, or VS Code, the payoff in productivity is
absolutely worth it.

### Extensions

First things first - let's get some awesome extensions installed. Since we'll be
juggling CMake, XML, and other config files, these will make our life so much easier.

Just hit `Ctrl+Shift P` (or `Cmd+Shift P` for Mac folks)
to pop open the command menu, then run `zed: extensions`.

<blockquote class="flex gap-6 justify-text items-center">
    <div class="flex-shrink-0">
        <Info/>
    </div>
    Pro tip: you can also use `Ctrl+Shift X` / `Cmd+Shift X` as a shortcut to jump straight to extensions.
</blockquote>

Here are the must-have extensions for our setup:

- NeoCMake (for all your CMake needs)
- XML (because who likes raw XML?)
- TOML (trust me, you'll thank me later)

And feel free to browse around the extension store - there are tons of cool ones
that might catch your eye.

### Settings

When working with CMake projects, you'll need to deal with `CMakeLists.txt` files. By
default, Zed doesn't know these are CMake files since they use the .txt extension. To
fix this, we'll need to update Zed's settings.

Open the command menu and search for `zed: open settings`. This will bring up a JSON
file that's probably empty if you're new to Zed. Add these lines to tell Zed how to
handle CMake files:

```json
{
    "file_types": {
        "CMake": [
            "CMakeLists.txt"
        ]
    },
}
```

### LSP

Zed ships with clangd to handle C and C++ code intelligence. While it might not have all
the bells and whistles of other language servers, clangd does exactly what you need it
to do. Code completion, jumping to definitions, and catching errors all work smoothly -
and that's what helps you write better code faster.

You'll want to set up `clang-tidy` and `clang-format` to make your code look clean and
consistent. First step is creating a `.clangd` file in your project's root folder. Let's
look at what goes in it.

```text
CompileFlags:
    CompilationDatabase: build
    Compiler: clang++
Diagnostics:
    MissingIncludes: None
    UnusedIncludes: None
    ClangTidy:
        Add: ["*"]
        Remove: [
            "llvmlibc-*",
            "fuchsia-*",
            "google-build-*",
            "modernize-use-trailing-return-type",
            "readability-identifier-length",
            "readability-magic-numbers",
            "cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers",
            "cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions",
            "hicpp-special-member-functions",
            "misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes",
            "cppcoreguidelines-non-private-member-variables-in-classes",
            "cppcoreguidelines-prefer-member-initializer",
            "altera-unroll-loops",
        ]
Index:
    Background: Build
```

Here's the deal - I'm using a `compile_commands.json` file that CMake generates to help
clangd track everything in the project. Don't worry, I'll show you how to set this up -
it's pretty crucial for getting things working smoothly. While I'm using `clang++` as
my compiler, you can totally pick whatever compiler works for you.

I ended up setting `MissingIncludes: None` and `UnusedInclude: None` because clang gets
a bit fussy with header files. You see, some headers bundle up other headers, and clang
likes to complain that certain types aren't being used directly. Super annoying! Give
these settings a try yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about.

For the `clang-tidy` setup, I kept things pretty straightforward. I turned on all checks
with `Add: ["*"]`, then just filtered out the ones I don't want in my project using
`Remove: [...]`. Nice and simple.

Now, let's talk about `clang-format`. Here's the setup I like to use. Keep in mind that
formatting preferences are pretty personal - what works for me might not work for you or
your team. Feel free to tweak these settings to match your style.

```yaml
---
Language: Cpp
BasedOnStyle: Google
ColumnLimit: 80
BinPackArguments: false
BinPackParameters: false
AllowAllParametersOfDeclarationOnNextLine: true
AllowAllArgumentsOnNextLine: true
AlignAfterOpenBracket: BlockIndent
NamespaceIndentation: All
```

## Pixi

Alright, now that we've got Zed set up just the way we want it, let's chat about Pixi.
If you've used modern package managers like uv or Poetry, you'll feel right at home with
Pixi - especially if you're coming from Python. For C/C++ folks, there might be a bit
of a learning curve, but stick with me.

Getting started is super simple. Just head over to [pixi.sh](https://pixi.sh), grab the
installer, and once installed, run:

```sh
pixi init
```

This creates two important files in your project:

- `pixi.toml`
- `.gitattributes`

The star of the show here is `pixi.toml` - think of it as your project's control center.
This is where you'll list all your project info and keep track of what packages you
need. The cool thing about Pixi is that it plays nice with both PyPI and [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).
While I won't dive into the nitty-gritty of conda-forge right now, trust me - it's a
game-changer for C/C++ projects.

The `pixi.toml` file will look like this:

```toml
[project]
authors = ["Alvaro <alvgaona@gmail.com>"]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
description = "Add a short description here"
name = "project-name"
platforms = ["linux-64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
```

You can define platform restrictions, add conda channels, and more metadata. Pretty straightforward.
In the ROS2 section we'll touch dependencies, tasks, and channels.

## ROS2

Alright, here comes the fun part - this is where everything comes together. We'll
be mixing C++ ROS2 nodes with some Python magic for our launch files. Since these
launch files are Python-based, we'll also dive into getting Python LSP working
smoothly in Zed.

First up, we need to tell ROS2 where to find its packages by tweaking our TOML file.
There's an awesome community maintaining ROS packages in what's called
`robostack-staging` - think of it as a treasure chest of ready-to-use ROS goodies.
Let's add that channel to our project. Here's how my TOML looks for the EKF Mono SLAM
project:

```toml
[project]
name = "ekf_mono_slam"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Visual Mono SLAM with 1-Point RANSAC EKF"
authors = ["Alvaro <alvgaona@gmail.com>"]
channels = ["conda-forge", "robostack-staging"]
platforms = ["osx-64", "linux-64"]

[tasks]

[dependencies]
```

Now for the good stuff - let's grab all the packages we need. Just run this command
and watch the magic happen:

```sh
pixi add ros-humble-desktop \
    colcon-common-extensions \
    ninja \
    cmake \
    pkg-config \
    compilers \
    ros-humble-ament-cmake-auto \
    spdlog \
    clang-format
```

By default, Pixi plays nicely with conda packages. But if you need something
from PyPI instead, no worries. Just add `--pypi` when you're installing the package.

A `pixi.lock` file will be added to your project. This is important to lock dependencies
and make things reproducible.

The `[dependencies]` section will look like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
ros-humble-desktop = ">=0.10.0,<0.11"
colcon-common-extensions = ">=0.3.0,<0.4"
ninja = ">=1.12.0,<1.13"
cmake = ">=3.28.3,<3.29"
pkg-config = ">=0.29.2,<0.30"
compilers = ">=1.7.0,<1.8"
ros-humble-ament-cmake-auto = ">=1.3.7,<1.4"
spdlog = ">=1.12.0,<1.13"
clang-format = ">=18.1.3,<18.2"
```

<blockquote class="flex gap-4 justify-text items-center">
    <div class="flex-shrink-0">
        <Info/>
    </div>
    The versions may vary but you get the gist of it.
</blockquote>

### ROS package & nodes

Let's set up our ROS package structure. First up, we need a solid folder layout. Here's my
favorite way to organize everything:

```text
.
|-- CMakeLists.txt
|-- include
|-- launch
|-- msg
|-- package.xml
|-- src
|-- srv
`-- test
```

It's pretty straightforward - you'll put your `.cpp` files in `src/` and headers in
`include/`. The other folders follow ROS conventions: `launch/` for startup files, `msg/`
and `srv/` for custom messages, and `test/` for your test files.

Next up is the all-important `package.xml` - think of it as your project's ID card. Here's
what it looks like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-model href="http://download.ros.org/schema/package_format3.xsd" schematypens="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"?>
<package format="3">
  <name>ekf_mono_slam</name>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
  <description>Visual Mono SLAM with 1-Point RANSAC EKF</description>
  <maintainer email="alvgaona@gmail.com">Alvaro J. Gaona</maintainer>
  <license>MIT</license>

  <buildtool_depend>ament_cmake</buildtool_depend>

  <depend>std_msgs</depend>
  <depend>sensor_msgs</depend>
  <depend>geometry_msgs</depend>

  <build_depend>rosidl_default_generators</build_depend>
  <exec_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</exec_depend>
  <member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>

  <test_depend>ament_lint_auto</test_depend>
  <test_depend>ament_lint_common</test_depend>
  <test_depend>ament_cmake_gtest</test_depend>

  <export>
    <build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>
  </export>
</package>
```

We're using `ament_cmake` as our build tool and pulling in some standard ROS message types
we'll need. To create our own custom messages (which is pretty cool), we need these three
special lines:

```xml
<build_depend>rosidl_default_generators</build_depend>
<exec_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</exec_depend>
<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>
```

And finally, we toss in some test dependencies and tell ROS this is a CMake project with
that export tag at the bottom. Nice and clean. 🚀

### CMakeLists.txt

This section is extemely important and not very straightforward. I kept several hours trying to make all work.
So [here](https://github.com/alvgaona/ekf-mono-slam/blob/8e10233ec916a4bc4060c625eadce52fbc747ad0/src/ekf-mono-slam/CMakeLists.txt) it goes.

Let's break down our CMakeLists.txt file into nice, digestible chunks. The whole thing
might look scary at first, but we'll take it step by step.

1. The Project Foundation

This is where we set up the basics - like telling CMake what version we need and making
sure we're using modern C++20. The compile commands file helps our editor understand the
code better.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)
project(ekf_mono_slam)

if(NOT CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
endif()

if(CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX OR CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "Clang")
    add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic)
endif()

set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)
```

2. Getting our tools ready

Here we grab all the packages we need. Think of it like making sure you have all your
tools before starting a big project. We need ROS2 stuff, computer vision libraries,
and some extras for logging and math. Since we're using Pixi you won't need to have a
system-level install of OpenCV, Eigen, and spdlog. This is all installed and managed by Pixi
which in the old days it wasn't possible.

```cmake
find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED)
find_package(sensor_msgs REQUIRED)
find_package(geometry_msgs REQUIRED)
find_package(cv_bridge REQUIRED)
find_package(image_transport REQUIRED)
find_package(Eigen3 3.4.0 REQUIRED)
find_package(OpenCV 4.9.0 REQUIRED)
find_package(spdlog 1.12.0 REQUIRED)
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)
```

3. Organizing our code

We sort our source files into neat little groups. Each `GLOB_RECURSE` command looks
through its folder and grabs all the .cpp files it finds. This keeps things tidy
and makes it easy to add new files later.

```cmake
file(GLOB_RECURSE config_src src/configuration/*.cpp)
file(GLOB_RECURSE math_src src/math/*.cpp)
file(GLOB_RECURSE filter_src src/filter/*.cpp)
file(GLOB_RECURSE image_src src/image/*.cpp)
file(GLOB_RECURSE feature_src src/feature/*.cpp)
file(GLOB_RECURSE visual_src src/visual/*.cpp)
```

This makes it easier for anyone new to browse through a C/C++ ROS2 project.
Here's how the folders are laid out:

```text
include
|-- configuration
|-- ekf_node.h
|-- feature
|-- feature_detector_node.h
|-- file_sequence_image_node.h
|-- filter
|-- image
|-- math
`-- visual

===

src
|-- ekf_node.cpp
|-- feature
|-- feature_detector_node.cpp
|-- file_sequence_image_node.cpp
|-- filter
|-- image
|-- math
`-- visual
```

The node files live directly under `src/` and `include/`. All the supporting code goes
into the other folders. This supporting code works independently of ROS - it just provides
the core functionality that the nodes use.

4. Setting up custom messages

This part lets us create our own message types for ROS2. These messages help our nodes
talk to each other. The typesupport stuff at the end helps C++ understand these custom
messages.

```cmake
set(msg_files
  "msg/State.msg"
  "msg/ImagePoint.msg"
  "msg/CovarianceMatrix.msg"
  "msg/ImageFeatureMeasurement.msg"
  "msg/ImageFeatureMeasurementArray.msg"
  "msg/ImageFeaturePrediction.msg"
)

set(srv_files
  "srv/FeatureDetect.srv"
)

rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  ${msg_files}
  ${srv_files}
  DEPENDENCIES
  sensor_msgs
  std_msgs
)

rosidl_get_typesupport_target(cpp_typesupport_target ${PROJECT_NAME} rosidl_typesupport_cpp)
```

5. Building the image node

This node handles loading and managing image sequences. We tell it what source files to
use, what libraries it needs, and where to find all its header files.

```cmake
add_executable(file_sequence_image src/file_sequence_image_node.cpp ${config_src} ${image_src})
ament_target_dependencies(file_sequence_image PUBLIC rclcpp std_msgs sensor_msgs cv_bridge image_transport)
target_link_libraries(file_sequence_image PUBLIC ${OpenCV_LIBRARIES} spdlog::spdlog)
target_include_directories(file_sequence_image
  PUBLIC
  "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>"
  "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/${PROJECT_NAME}>"
  ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
```

6. Setting up the feature detector

Same idea as the image node, but this one spots interesting points in our images that
we can track. It needs access to OpenCV for computer vision stuff.

```cmake
add_executable(feature_detector src/feature_detector_node.cpp ${feature_src} ${visual_src})
ament_target_dependencies(feature_detector PUBLIC rclcpp std_msgs sensor_msgs cv_bridge)
target_link_libraries(feature_detector PUBLIC ${OpenCV_LIBRARIES} spdlog::spdlog ${cpp_typesupport_target})
target_include_directories(feature_detector
  PUBLIC
  "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>"
  "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/${PROJECT_NAME}>"
  ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  ${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
```

7. Building the main EKF node

This is our star player - the Extended Kalman Filter node. It needs pretty much
everything we've got: math libraries, computer vision, and ROS messaging.

```cmake
add_executable(ekf src/ekf_node.cpp ${filter_src} ${math_src} ${feature_src} ${visual_src})
ament_target_dependencies(ekf PUBLIC rclcpp std_msgs sensor_msgs geometry_msgs cv_bridge image_transport)
target_link_libraries(ekf PUBLIC ${OpenCV_LIBRARIES} spdlog::spdlog ${cpp_typesupport_target})
target_include_directories(ekf
  PUBLIC
  "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>"
  "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/${PROJECT_NAME}>"
  ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  ${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
```

8. Making our package installable

We tell ROS where to put our finished programs and launch files when someone installs
our package. Pretty standard stuff.

```cmake
install(TARGETS
  file_sequence_image
  ekf
  feature_detector
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
)

install(DIRECTORY
  launch
  DESTINATION share/${PROJECT_NAME}
)
```

9. Getting ready for testing

Last but not least, we set up our test suite. We grab all our test files, but skip
the node files since we don't want to test those directly. GMock helps us write
better tests.

```cmake
if(BUILD_TESTING)
    set(test_src
    "test/utest_math.cpp"
    "test/utest_feature.cpp"
    "test/utest_filter.cpp"
    "test/utest_image.cpp"
  )
    file(GLOB_RECURSE src_for_test src/*.cpp)
    list(FILTER src_for_test EXCLUDE REGEX "src/.*_node.cpp")

    find_package(ament_cmake_gmock REQUIRED)

    ament_add_gmock(slam_test ${test_src} ${src_for_test})
    ament_target_dependencies(slam_test std_msgs OpenCV)
    target_link_libraries(slam_test spdlog::spdlog)
    target_include_directories(slam_test PUBLIC
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>
    ${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  )
endif()

ament_package()
```

### Launch files

Since our launch files use Python, we need to get Python LSP working in Zed.
Zed uses Pyright for Python language support, and setting it up with Pixi is pretty
straightforward. Remember that Pixi manages dependencies through conda environments,
storing everything in a `.pixi` folder at your project's root.

To point Pyright to the right Python interpreter, create a `pyrightconfig.json` file in
your project root:

```json
{
    "venvPath": ".pixi/envs",
    "venv": "default"
}
```

The `venv` setting should match your conda environment name. You can adjust this based on
how you've configured your Pixi project.

Just for the sake of completion, I'm just showing you a ROS2 launch file.

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node
from launch.actions import DeclareLaunchArgument
from launch.substitutions import LaunchConfiguration


def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription(
        [
            DeclareLaunchArgument(
                "image_dir", default_value="./resources/desk_translation/"
            ),
            Node(
                package="ekf_mono_slam",
                executable="file_sequence_image",
                name="file_sequence_image",
                namespace="slam",
                output="screen",
                parameters=[
                    {"image_dir": LaunchConfiguration("image_dir")},
                ],
                arguments=["--ros-args", "--log-level", "info"],
            ),
            Node(
                package="ekf_mono_slam",
                executable="ekf",
                name="ekf",
                namespace="slam",
                output="screen",
                arguments=["--ros-args", "--log-level", "info"],
            ),
            Node(
                package="ekf_mono_slam",
                executable="feature_detector",
                name="feature_detector",
                namespace="slam",
                output="screen",
                arguments=["--ros-args", "--log-level", "info"],
            ),
        ]
    )
```

## Building & testing

Building and testing ROS2 packages uses colcon, which can be a bit tricky at first. Here's a
reliable command to build your package:

```sh
colcon build \
  --symlink-install \
  --event-handler \
  console_direct+ \
  --cmake-args \
  -G Ninja \
  -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/python
```

And when you want to run the tests:

```sh
colcon test --ctest-args tests ekf_mono_slam && ./build/ekf_mono_slam/slam_test
```

<blockquote class="flex gap-6 justify-text items-center">
  <div class="flex-shrink-0">
    <Info/>
  </div>
  Note: Make sure the test executable name matches what you defined in your CMake setup.
</blockquote>

Those commands are pretty lengthy to type out each time. We can make life easier by adding
them as Pixi tasks. Open your `pixi.toml` and add these under the `[tasks]` section:

```toml
[tasks]
build = { cmd = [
  "colcon",
  "build",
  "--symlink-install",
  "--event-handler",
  "console_direct+",
  "--cmake-args",
  "-G Ninja",
  "-DPython3_EXECUTABLE=$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/python",
] }
test = { cmd = [
  "colcon",
  "test",
  "--ctest-args",
  "tests",
  "ekf_mono_slam",
  "&&",
  "./build/ekf_mono_slam/slam_test",
] }
```

Now you can build and test with a simple command:

```sh
pixi run build && pixi run test
```

## Final thoughts

This combination of Zed, Pixi, and ROS2 has truly transformed how I approach robotics
development. Zed's speed and efficiency, paired with Pixi's seamless dependency
management and ROS2's robust robotics framework, creates a development environment
that's both powerful and pleasant to use.

While setting up this stack requires some initial investment, the productivity gains
are well worth it. The ability to work cross-platform with consistent environments,
combined with modern development tools, has eliminated many of the traditional
pain points in robotics development.

A particularly exciting aspect of this setup is [Zed's remote development capabilities](https://zed.dev/blog/remote-development)
and [AI assistance](https://zed.dev/blog/zed-ai). When working with robotic platforms,
being able to seamlessly connect to and develop directly on robot hardware through Zed Remote
is invaluable. The built-in AI copilot also helps tremendously with ROS2 boilerplate code and
common robotics patterns, making development even more efficient.

It's worth noting that Pixi isn't just for robotics - it's an excellent package manager
for any C/C++ project. Through conda-forge, it provides easy access to thousands of
pre-built libraries and tools, eliminating the traditional headaches of C/C++ dependency
management. Whether you're building a game engine, a scientific computing application,
or a systems tool, Pixi can dramatically simplify your build and dependency setup.

While the project itself is still a work in progress, you can find enough code and
configurations in my [EKF Mono SLAM repository](https://github.com/alvgaona/ekf-mono-slam)
to explore and understand how this development stack works together. I encourage you to
experiment with these tools and adapt them to your own workflow.

The future of robotics development is moving toward more integrated, cross-platform
solutions, and I believe this stack represents a significant step in that direction.
Whether you're building SLAM systems, working on robot control, or developing new
algorithms, this modern development environment can help you work more effectively.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to share your own experiences
with this setup. Happy coding! 🤖
