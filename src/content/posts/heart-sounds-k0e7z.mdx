tl;dr

One of my real experiences in the field of AI was processing biological signals with deep learning.
I met Dr. Pedro Arini, a researcher in the field of biomedical engineering and a great professor,
who introduced me to the problem of phonocardiogram (PCG) segmentation.
In this blog post, I will try to explain what this is about and all the possible details about
the approach I developed.

## The Phonocardiogram

Almost everyone has heard the sound the heart makes when it pumps blood through our entire body, right?
Well, this sound is very unique as we can hear two beats, and in between, we hear "nothing".

The first beat is called $S_1$ and the second beat is called $S_2$, and the time between $S_1$ and $S_2$ is called
_systole interval_ and the time between $S_2$ and the next $S_1$ is called _diastole interval_.
This is important as it'll be useful when we process the signals.

Then, if we record the sound and plot it in a graph that is called a _phonocardiogram_.

## A Little History

The idea of heart sound segmentation dates back to 1997 where H. Liang _et al._ used a deterministic
algorithm based on the normalized Shannon energy of a PCG signal achieiving a 93% correct ratio.
