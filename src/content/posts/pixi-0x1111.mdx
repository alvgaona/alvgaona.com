tl;dr

My experience with Pixi has began not long ago.
During my time at the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (LINAR) as part of the research team,
a very good friend of mine had told me about RoboStack when we were having trouble installing ROS distributions
on our personal machines and in our cluster of servers with GPU support.
A couple years ago it was extremely daunting to install ROS in any of the supported operating systems;
in particular, Ubuntu distributions were the mainly supported OS at the time and it still remains that way.
Ubuntu is probably the first distribution that you mostly everyone will install on their very first days of using a Linux distribution,
and I think it's the right way to go, it's easy to set up and the UX/UI is good enough.
However, as you start becoming a more advanced user you will see that it has many limitations.
I believe the most annoying "feature" of Ubuntu is that its dependencies get old, and many of them are fixed to the
Ubuntu distribution.
This is the case for Python and ROS, and two technologies came to help us here: RoboStack, and pyenv.

## RoboStack

Open Robotics created this project called RoboStack to bundle ROS packages and make it available on multiple platforms:

1. Linux
2. Mac
3. Windows

It's backed by Conda and all the features this package manager provides.
I have to recognize the hard work that's been put into Conda, it's paved the way for the better package managers, but
it was a too slow for me, and buggy at the time.
It's possible the team has improved the performance and solved many bugs but I haven't come back to using conda directly.
To me it was no surprise RoboStack leveraged `conda` to install another package manager called `mamba`.
This cross-platform package manager is the one that is used to install any ROS distribution in any OS.
This was mind blowing to me when we tested this in the laboratory, we could have the latest ROS distribution
on Ubuntu 2021 for instance, and even so, multiple ROS distributions on the same machine.
This was possible as there is this concept of isolated environments that you could activate and deactivate.
This feature is nowadays extremely useful for people in other fields such as signal processing, data science, and so on.
