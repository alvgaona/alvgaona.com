tl;dr

I’ve been actively searching for a doctoral position in the field of robotics for quite some time now. Initially, I focused my search within the European Union, but due to the scarcity of positions, I am now exploring other locations as well. There are several countries with excellent universities and research laboratories that offer great research projects.

The purpose of this document is to log all the necessary information required to find suitable doctoral positions and make it happen.

## Universities

These are the universities with robotics laboratories that are aligned with my interests. I’ll make a couple comments on each one of them and its laboratories.

- ETH Zurich
- École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)
- University of Zurich (UZH)
- Queensland University of Technology (QUT)
- Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)
- Technical University of Münich (TUM)
- University of Sydney
- University of Delft

## Documents Required

Generally, you need to multiple documents to provide to the universities when you apply to a Ph. D. position. Here’s a list of all required documents:

- **Curriculum Vitae (CV)**: Detailing your academic and professional background, research experience, publications, and awards.
- **Degree Certificate**: This is a fundamental requirement for a Ph.D. application, as it serves as the official document issued by the university where you obtained your previous degree.
- **Transcripts**: Equally important, transcripts provide a comprehensive record of the subjects completed during your university studies, including the grades and credits for each subject. Universities use this information to assess your academic background and suitability for their research projects.
- **Letters of Recommendation**: Typically, three letters from academic or professional references are required. It can be beneficial to obtain letters from individuals in your field of interest.
- **Motivation Letter**: A motivation letter is a document that describes your personal motivation and competence for a Ph.D. program. It is usually submitted together with your academic CV to provide admissions staff with more information to help them decide whether or not you are the ideal candidate for a research project.
- **Research Proposal or Statement**: A document outlining your proposed research topic and its significance.
- **Language Proficiency**: Proof of proficiency in the language of instruction, often demonstrated through tests like IELTS or TOEFL.
- **Hague Apostille**: Not typically required for Ph.D. applications in the European Union and the United States
