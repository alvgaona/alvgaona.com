tl;dr

One of the most famous controllers out there is the Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller, there is an unbelieveable number of
variations around this controller, e.g, Data-driven MPC, Robust MPC, Nonlinear MPC.
At the time of this writing, we can see that MPC controller is often beating Reinforcement Learning approaches.
In general, the hard part of this controller is to come up with a resilient model of the plant.
